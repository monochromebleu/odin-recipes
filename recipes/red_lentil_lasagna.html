    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini/courgette, chopped into 1cm cubes (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked red lentils</li>
        <li>6 (approx.) gluten free or regular lasagna sheets/noodles as needed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dried mixed Italian herbs</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan cheese shreds or slices</li>
        <li>3 cups crushed tomatoes (just under one 800ml can)</li>
        <li>1½ cup vegetable stock (1 stock cube dissolved in 1½ cups boiling water))</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped into 1cm cubes (about 1½ cups)</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups unsweetened soy or coconut milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>For the Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan on a low heat, combine all sauce ingredients (using a metal whisk to remove any lumps if needed).</li>
        <li>Heat the mixture for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until it thickens and resembles cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F/175°C.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, zucchini and red pepper and sauté for a further 5 minutes, continuing to stir.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomatoes, lentils, stock and dried herbs. Increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the lentils are completely soft.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>To Assemble</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the tomato/lentil filling into a deep ovenproof dish (just enough to cover the bottom of the dish).</li>
        <li>Cover this with 3 of the lasagna sheets/noodles, and pour half the cheese sauce over these evenly. (If your cheese sauce has become too thick while you've been making the tomato/lentil filling, simply reheat it very gently or thin it out with a small amount of water.)</li>
        <li>Repeat the process, using all the remaining tomato/lentil filling, the remaining 3 lasagna sheets and the remaining cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese shreds over the top, and cover the dish in foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes in the oven, remove the foil and bake for a further 15 minutes until cheese/cheese sauce is golden.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favourite salad for a hearty, protein-packed dinner!</li>
    </ol>
